/**
 * This package provides code supporting the execution of the main XMLValidator program.
 * Code inside this package is strictly XML specific.
 * This package contains helpful routines to parse, check, modify, build and rewrite XML files.
 * It also contains routines to build the graphtree representations of the XML files.
 * For code that is XML agnostic and only used for the specific XMLValidator program implementation, see {@link su.pbg.jh1.jxmlvalidator.programlib}

//Modular package.
//If you want to use this package in a different project, consider changing the javadoc above as it itself is specific to the XMLValidator implementation.
//Other javadoc text should be implementation agnostic.
